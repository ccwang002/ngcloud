Installation
============
One is encouraged to develop under a virtual environment.

To make installed NGCloud immediately reflect code change::

    python setup.py develop
    # or
    pip install -e .[all]

Extra dependencies are required to enable syntax checking::

    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
